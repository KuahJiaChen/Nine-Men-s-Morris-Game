# FIT3077 Project - Nine Men Morris Game

This repository contains the Java implementation of the Nine Men's Morris game, built using IntelliJ and Java Swing and AWT libraries to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to design and implement a fully functional Nine Men's Morris game using an object-oriented approach. The repository contains the code for a desktop application developed in Java using the Swing library. The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a well-structured design with clear separation of concerns and low coupling between components. Design patterns such as the observer pattern and command pattern were utilized, along with adherence to SOLID object-oriented principles, to enhance extensibility and maintainability.

Detailed design documentation was created using UML diagrams to provide a comprehensive overview of the application's structure, illustrating the relationships and interactions between components.

By employing these design strategies and principles, the application offers an enjoyable gameplay experience while promoting code modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## Development Sprints

The development is divided into multiple sprints, each focusing on specific tasks and milestones. The details of each sprint are as follows:

|          | Demos                               | Present and demonstrate the prototype                     |
| Sprint 4 | Introduce additional feature         | Implement an additional feature                           |
|          | Updated user stories (requirements)  | Update user stories based on feedback                     |
|          | Final prototype                     | Develop the final working prototype                       |
|          | Architecture & Design rationales     | Explain the rationale for the design                      |
|          | Demo video                          | Create a video demonstrating the game                     |

Please note that the completion of each sprint contributes to the overall progress and enhancement of the Nine Men's Morris game project.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Java with JDK 17
- IDE: IntelliJ
- Libraries Used: Java Swing, Java AWT

## Advanced Features

In addition to the core functionality of the Nine Men's Morris game, the project incorporates advanced features to enhance the overall user experience. These features include:

1. Tutorial Mode: A tutorial mode has been added to the game to assist users who are not familiar with Nine Men's Morris. This mode provides step-by-step instructions and guidance to help users understand the rules and gameplay mechanics.

2. Hint System: During matches, players have the option to enable "hints" that show all the legal moves they can make as their next move. This feature aids players in making informed decisions and strategizing their moves effectively.

3. Single Player Mode: The game includes a single player mode where players can compete against the computer. The computer opponent randomly selects a move from all currently valid moves or utilizes a set of heuristics chosen by the development team. This mode offers an engaging and challenging gameplay experience for solo players.

These advanced features enhance the accessibility, educational value, and competitiveness of the Nine Men's Morris game.

## How to Run

1. **Run the project.jar file**
   
   - Navigate to the src folder.
   - Run the `project.jar` file to execute the application and launch the game.

2. **Alternative Method**

   If the first option fails, use IntelliJ IDE to run the code:

   - Open the project in IntelliJ.
   - Locate the `Application.java` file in the project structure.
   - Right-click on the `Application` class and select "Run" from the context menu to execute the main method and start the game.

Please ensure you have the required dependencies and a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine for both options.
